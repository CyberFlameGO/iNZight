The latest release sees a full refactoring of some back-end functionality,
but most of the interface remains the same.

We are also introducing a new Module system that will slowly take over the
modules currently in the 'Advanced' menu. For the time being, we will leave
the old modules in place, but will no longer be developed.
We encourage you to install and try out the new modules in the 'Modules' menu!

We hope you enjoy! As always, let us know if you find issues or have suggestions
using the contact button in the Help menu.
