We've gone ahead and made a few improvements ...

- Code writing for plots, summaries, and inference!
  It's not enabled by default, but the biggest change in this release
  is the implementation of interactive code snippets, enabled from
  File > Preferences. You can see the R code for the current plot,
  and edit it to see what happens. Learning R just got easier!

- Get Summary and Get Inference have been redesigned
  Now more consistent with the rest of iNZight, you can quickly add and
  remove inference information, adjust your hypothesis, and see the
  results instantly.

- Survey designs are now completely supported: plots, summaries,
  and data wrangling! 

- Plus other bug fixes and improvements.
